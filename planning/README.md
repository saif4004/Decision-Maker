1. User Registration (It is empty just to show we can have something like that on the website)
2. User can create multiple decision process
3. User can re-use/have access to privious decision sessions that they created.
4. (Maybe a strech) User can click a button that randomly selects an option for them to chose from. User can choose from common decision templates about the subject
5. User can be able to save their frequently made decisions so they can use them later if they want. 
6. User can view their history of my previous decisions

thats all I can think of for now. Will add more tomorrow
